I travelled to more than 30 countries during the last few years.
**I always make a note when someone tells me "Oh, you should totally visit that restaurant in %city%"**

This is a list of points of interest (cafes, restaurants, markets) sorted by cities.
An item included in the list doesn't guarantee it's worth visiting or that I've been there. It's up to you to check reviews on Yelp!

PRs are welcome.
